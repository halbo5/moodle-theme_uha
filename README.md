UHA

UHA is a child theme for Moodle's core theme Boost.

The aim of this theme is to make teachers job more efficient by simplifiying Moodle. See below for other tricks.

Here are the main enhancements:

Enhanced Frontpage - MyOverview displays 50 courses per page instead of 6
My Courses menu in the header
Personnalized Links in footer
Personnalized text in frontpage when not connected
Colors and css changes, for example to better view the settings dropdowns
Removed date modified in "page" activity
UHA is a child theme of Boost. This means when Moodle updates the core Boost theme those changes will be applied to Fordson as well in most cases.

Install from Github

Click on the button to "Clone or Download" https://github.com/Halbo5/moodle-theme_uha. When downloaded to your computer, unzip it. It should create a folder named "moodle-theme_uha-master". Rename the folder so that it is "uha" (without quotes). You can FTP that folder to your moodle site in /moodle/theme/ directory. Or you can create a new ZIP file of the "fordson" folder and upload and install it via the Plugin Administration in Site Administration.

Less is better :-)

Our aim is to make things more simple :-) In conjonction with this theme, we also use some plugins :

Expert Role : we created two teacher roles. One simple and one complete. The plugin affects the right role depending of the teacher's choice. The simple role has no blocks, less activities, less reports, ...
Boost Navigation Fumbling : reduce number of menu-items
Teacher Assistant : shows a button on frontpage to create a course and some ressources to help using Moodle.
